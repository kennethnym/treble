# treble

**work in progress!**

treble is a [wasm](https://webassembly.org/) virtual machine designed to be used with [clef](https://github.com/kennethnym/clef). 

because wasm is language agnostic, it allows future web apps built for clef to be built using any programming language that can compile to wasm, not just javascript. plus, treble will also support multithreading to power the most demanding of web apps.
